# This tests heat transfer. Air is enclosed in a pipe with a constant wall temperature
# higher than the initial temperature of the fluid. The temperature of the
# fluid should approach the wall temperature, density should remain constant,
# pressure should increase, and the velocity should stay zero.
#
# rho @ (p = 1e5 Pa, T = 300 K) = 1.1494252873563 kg/m^3
