# Models two pipe segments of equal area connected by a junction that has
# losses. The inlet BC uses (p0, T0), and the outlet BC uses p. With a loss
# coefficient of 0.5, the stagnation pressure in the downstream pipe should be
# halfway between the the stagnation pressure of the inlet p0 value and the
# outlet p value. Therefore, the correct p0 value in the second pipe should
# be p0 = 1.29788778926625 Pa.
