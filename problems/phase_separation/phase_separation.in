# This is a 2-phase problem known as the "Sedimentation problem", taken from
# the following reference:
#
# A. Ambroso, C. Chalons, and P.-A. Raviart
# A Godunov-type method for the seven-equation model of compressible two-phase flow
# Computers & Fluids 54 (2012) 67-91
#
# Both phases use ideal gas EOS, and the following gamma values are used:
#   liquid: gamma = 1.0005
#   vapor:  gamma = 1.4
# Cv is chosen here to be 1 for both, although this isn't explicitly stated in
# the reference above, probably because the temperature is irrelevant to this problem.
#
# The IC are uniform, given by the following values:
#   alpha_liquid = 0.5
#   rho_liquid   = 1000
#   rho_vapor    = 1
#   vel_liquid   = 0
#   vel_vapor    = 0
#   p_liquid     = 1e5
#   p_vapor      = 1e5
#
# The spatial domain is (0, 7.5), and the acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 m/s^2.
# Results are typically plotted at t = 0.8.
