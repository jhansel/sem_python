# This is a 2-phase Riemann problem taken from Test 2 of the following reference:
#
# A. Ambroso, C. Chalons, and P.-A. Raviart
# A Godunov-type method for the seven-equation model of compressible two-phase flow
# Computers & Fluids 54 (2012) 67-91
#
# Both phases use ideal gas EOS with gamma = 1.4. Cv is chosen here to be 1,
# though this isn't explicitly stated in the reference above, probably because
# the temperature is irrelevant to this problem.
#
# Left state:              Right state:
#   alpha_liquid = 0.8       alpha_liquid = 0.3
#   rho_liquid   = 1.0       rho_liquid   = 1.0
#   vel_liquid   = 0.0       vel_liquid   = 0.0
#   p_liquid     = 1.0       p_liquid     = 1.0
#   rho_vapor    = 0.2       rho_vapor    = 1.0
#   vel_vapor    = 0.0       vel_vapor    = 0.0
#   p_vapor      = 0.3       p_vapor      = 1.0
#
# The domain is (0,1) with the interface at 0.5.
# Results are typically plotted at t = 0.2.
