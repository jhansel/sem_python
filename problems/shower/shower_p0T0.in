# This problem models a "shower" setup: water from a hot pipe and a cold pipe
# mix in a junction and exit in a warm mixture.
#
#      HOT ->
#  *------------*   WARM ->
#               *------------*
#  *------------*
#     COLD ->
#
# This version uses the (p0, T0) inlet boundary condition. Currently, this
# doesn't run; one must use (rho, u) inlet boundary condition instead.
