# This test problem is the classic Sod shock tube test problem,
# which is a Riemann problem with the following parameters:
#   * domain = (0,1)
#   * gravity = 0
#   * fluid = air (ideal gas with gamma = 1.4, R = 287.058)
#   * interface: x = 0.5
#   * typical end time: 0.2
# Left initial values:
#   * rho = 1
#   * u = 0
#   * p = 1
# Right initial values:
#   * rho = 0.125
#   * u = 0
#   * p = 0.1
