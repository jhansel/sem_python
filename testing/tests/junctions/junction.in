# This tests an arbitrary 1-phase junction. The setup consists of 2 meshes
# connected by a junction. At t = 0, a wave of differing density enters the left
# boundary, and it should propagate through the junction without any
# disturbance; ideally, it should be the same solution as without the junction.
